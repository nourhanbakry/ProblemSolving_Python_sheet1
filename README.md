# Problem Solving - Python (Sheet 1 - Codeforces)

Hey there! Welcome to my little coding folder ðŸ“‚  
This is where I keep my Python solutions for **Sheet 1** problems from Codeforces. Itâ€™s perfect for anyone starting out with problem-solving or just wanting to peek at some Python code in action!

---

## Whatâ€™s This Folder About?  
This is my stash of solved problems from Codeforces Sheet 1, all coded up in Python. Think of it as a beginnerâ€™s guide to tackling competitive programming challengesâ€”one solution at a time.

## Inside the Folder  
- **Files**: Python scripts for each problem (like `Problem A.py`, `Problem B.py`, etc.).  
- **Language**: Python 3 (simple and sweet).  
- **Purpose**: Practice basic coding skillsâ€”inputs, loops, if-statements, you name it!
